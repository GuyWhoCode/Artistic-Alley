## Project Description
Many artists currently rely on traditional methods, like email, to handle commissions. The absence of a dedicated app creates a gap in how artists connect with potential clients and manage their commissions. <br> <br>
An app dedicated to artist commissions streamlines the entire process. Artists can showcase their work, specify their commission offerings, and manage requests efficiently, all within a centralized platform.
